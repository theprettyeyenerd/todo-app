# 100 Days of JavaScript: Todo Web App  ðŸš€ **Embarking on a 100-day JavaScript challenge!** As an intermediate developer, I'm passionate about building web applications, solving puzzles, and making things work.
  My goal is to learn, practice, and build exciting projects every day for the next 100 days.

- Mark tasks as done
- Delete completed tasks
- Clean and minimalistic design
  
  **Technologies used**
-  HTML

   **How to Use**
